# Socket.io server
This server is made to handle web-socket connection for a real-time chat app built with **Socket.io**, You can click [Here](https://github.com/sm-harun/RTC-app) to visit its repository.
This server doesn't return any front end it only handles web socket connections.

## Build Instructions
```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/sm-harun/RTC-socket

npm install

# Then use this to run.
npm run socket
```
It runs on port **:3001** and the front-end code also searches the server on this port. Feel free to change it.
